<h3>School Projects</h3>
<br>

For the founding members of Katkatha the love for puppetry began in school. Thus our focus on schools and school children and teachers has always been strong. Puppets are not just a form of entertainment for children but to make your own puppet, manipulate it on stage, to write the script for a puppet play or design lights and sound can be a life altering experience for children. For a teacher, puppets can be the key to opening a world of possibilities for her students enabling them to learn in multiple ways. The arts change lives and world view. We believe in this very passionately at Katkatha.
