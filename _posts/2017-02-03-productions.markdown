<h3>ABOUT RAM (2006)</h3>

<br>
      
As the name suggests, the performance is about Ram, the prince who is sent on a long journey far away from his home when he is exiled by his father along with his wife Sita and brother Lakshman. Sita is kidnapped by Ravan the king of Lanka and kept prisoner. As Ram sits by the ocean looking at Lanka across its vastness his life flashes by, he feels powerless and dejected as he longs to fly across the ocean to his beloved Sita. The puppeteers help him by projecting his desires into the mask of the super hero Hanuman which attaches itself to Rams face, at one turning him into a super powerful simian who leaps across the ocean and reaches Sita.
<br>
In this journey and the bloody war that follows with Ravan, Ram becomes a king, forced to choose between the duty of the throne and the love of his wife.He rules alone for the next 10,000 years.</h4>

<h3>CELEBRATION OF LIFE (2004)</h3>

<h4>For World AIDS Day Celebrated by Delhi Public Society involving children from 10 DPS Schools and positive people from DNPP.

Was commissioned by the Delhi Public Society as a way of bringing the participation of young people in the area of HIV/AIDS. It was taken by a step further by joining hands with the Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP +) and turning it into a collaboration between people living with HIV and young people from schools of Delhi cemented by the medium of puppetry.
<br>

Celebrations of life starts with the Big Bang , the creation of the universe and the  elements  Earth, Water ,Fire  which led to the creation of life on earth. It looks at the live and the love to two primeval beings born from the earth. But this love is doomed because of HIV. This virus turns into not a medical condition but a saga of stigma, discrimination and separation. The script is actually voices of 4 individuals living with HIV, their experiences of discrimination and rejection by loved ones and finally their finding of a reason not just to go on but to celebrate life.</h4>

<h3>VIRUS KA TAMASHAH</h3>

<h4>Was commissioned by the Delhi Public Society as a way of bringing the participation of young people in the area of HIV/AIDS. The performance traveled to several of the DPS schools as a part of the “Jagrit” programme aimed at educating young people about HIV and also initiating a dialogue about high risk behavior. The main challenge during this performance was to talk about HIV/Aids in a way that would both entertain and also lead to an openness towards the theme among school children.
<br>

Virus the Tamashsa is like a circus and a razzmatazz  Bollywood film rolled into one. It is literally a ride taken with the virus.The performance begins with the HIV positive protagonist being chastised and segregated by his community. The HIV Virus represented by the  “madari” or ringmaster intervenes, he tempts the members of the community in different situations to behave Irresponsibly. The first one by having unprotected sex with multiple partners, the second by using pre-used syringes, the third by using untested blood and treating a pregnant positive mother not medically but by a god-man. Finally he takes the audience into the human body and gives us a glimpse into the  effect the virus has on the WBCs and consequently the immune system. Finally he turns into an all powerful creature. In the end the main protagonist resists the virus by seeking help from the community of the audience asking them to stop discrimination and instead acting responsibly, saving themselves from infection.</h4>
