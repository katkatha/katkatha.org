<h3>Projects</h3>
<br>

Over the years Katkatha has grown organically to expand the possibilities of using puppetry by looking at applied puppetry and exploring multiple collaborative projects both in India and abroad. What is applied puppetry? In short, it is the exploration of the art form beyond its entertainment value, in fields like education, advocacy, awareness building, initiating discussion on socio-political issues and aiding in therapy.

<h4>Community and Peacebuilding Projects â€“ </h4>

Kashmir Project (2006). Supported by WISCOMP, this project took place in Kashmir, in the village of Beejbehara, near Srinagar where 25 young women aged of 18-25 worked with team Katkatha using masks and puppets and writer B.Gauri for 7 months to explore personal stories of growing up and living in Kashmir through the conflict years and the poetry of sufi poetess Lal Ded (whose shrine lies in Beejbehara) . The process culminated in a show by team Katkatha, scripted by B Gauri and titled Kashmir Project which premiered in 2007.
