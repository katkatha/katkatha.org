<h3>Projects</h3>
<br>
<h4> Over the years Katkatha has grown organically to expand the possibilities of using puppetry by looking at applied puppetry and exploring multiple collaborative projects both in India and abroad. What is applied puppetry? In short, it is the exploration of the art form beyond its entertainment value, in fields like education, advocacy, awareness building, initiating discussion on socio-political issues and aiding in therapy. <h3> 

<h4>Community and Peacebuilding Projects –</h4>

<h4>Peace building</h4>

Kashmir Project (2006). Supported by WISCOMP, this project took place in Kashmir, in the village of Beejbehara, near Srinagar where 25 young women aged of 18-25 worked with team Katkatha using masks and puppets and writer B.Gauri for 7 months to explore personal stories of growing up and living in Kashmir through the conflict years and the poetry of sufi poetess Lal Ded (whose shrine lies in Beejbehara) . The process culminated in a show by team Katkatha, scripted by B Gauri and titled Kashmir Project which premiered in 2007.

<h4>School Projects –</h4>

For the founding members of Katkatha the love for puppetry began in school. Thus our focus on schools and school children and teachers has always been strong. Puppets are not just a form of entertainment for children but to make your own puppet, manipulate it on stage, to write the script for a puppet play or design lights and sound can be a life altering experience for children. For a teacher, puppets can be the key to opening a world of possibilities for her students enabling them to learn in multiple ways. The arts change lives and world view. We believe in this very passionately at Katkatha.

<h4>International Projects –</h4>

Freida Leon, collaborated to create a performance "The Swiss Box"  (September, 2011) supported by Pro Helvetia. 

WW1 project in France with Vasant Valley and Shiv Nadar School. Katkatha collaborated from 2013-2019 with the French puppetry group ‘Le Tas de Sable Ches Panses Vertes’at a project, looking at a century of WWI. The team worked with two Delhi schools, Vasant Valley and Shiv Nadar for two years each. The purpose was to look at the impacts of war, most notably through the concept of exiles, or refugees.

During the meetings, children were oriented to puppetry and the themes of the First World War through a brief research of the situation of the Indian soldiers participating in World War I, which was conducted by reading letters of the soldiers and replying to them, and building models of the trenches.

In Shiv Nadar each child collected a personal story of exile from a neighbour or their own family. They discovered that Delhi is a city of refugees. Almost every person in Delhi came from somewhere else. Many came from Pakistan or Bangladesh when the country was partitioned, many from Kashmir who fled during the conflict. These families carried many memories. All of these came together in stories and poems, bound together by the central idea of enforced homelessness. Some examples of the work done may be found [here](http://objetsguerresetpaix.com/groupes-groups/shiv-nadar-school-india/).

The performance creations of both schools then travelled to Amiens, France, to stage their play in 2015 and 2018.
